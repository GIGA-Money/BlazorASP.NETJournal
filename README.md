# Blazor ASP.NET Journal

This project is a personal journal built using Blazor and ASP.NET. It's designed to provide an interactive and dynamic way to view and manage journal entries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. Once you have that, you can clone this repository and run the project locally.

## Project Structure

The project starts small, with the initial focus on loading and displaying existing HTML journal entries. These entries are stored in a dedicated folder within the project.

## Development Steps

Here are the initial development steps for this project:

1. Set up and run the Blazor template.
2. Add your HTML journal entries to a dedicated folder in the project.
3. Load the HTML entries into strings from the folder.
4. Create a page for displaying the HTML entries. The route could be the file name.
5. Display the HTML entries. This could be as simple as placing the string into a div. Some simple transformations might be necessary.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
